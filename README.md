# Predicting Titanic Survival

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. Our primary objective is to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving or not during the tragic Titanic disaster based on various passenger attributes.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:

PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger

Survived: Target variable (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)

Name: Passenger’s name

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic

Ticket: Ticket number

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port where the passenger boarded (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
## Installation

## 1.Install Required Python Libraries:
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip. These libraries are essential for data analysis, visualization, and building the predictive model.

The required libraries include:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.

seaborn: Built on top of matplotlib, it’s also used for advanced data visualization.

Install these libraries by running the following command:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## 2.Download the Titanic Dataset:

Download the Titanic dataset (CSV file) from Kaggle or any other reliable source. Place the dataset file in the project directory.

## 3.Explore the Data:
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
    
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the dataset. Key steps include:

1.Handling missing values (imputing missing ages and embarked locations).

2.Encoding categorical variables (gender and embarked location) into numerical format.

3.Feature engineering (e.g., creating a new feature like “FamilySize” by combining “SibSp” and “Parch”).

4.Removing unnecessary columns (e.g., “PassengerId,” “Name,” “Ticket,” “Cabin,” and “Fare”).
## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
EDA helps us gain insights into the dataset. We analyze:

Distribution of survival to understand class imbalance.

Age distribution to observe passenger demographics.

Survival by passenger class to identify trends.
